Hello Everyone! 👋

I have completed the training called "Let's Develop a Dynamic Portfolio with Admin Panel with Asp.Net Core Part 1-2", which is available for free on Udemy under the instructor of Murat Yücedağ within M&Y Software Education Academy Consultancy. This was my first project with .NET Core!

🚀 Technologies Used:

💻 Asp.Net Core 6.0: A powerful framework for modern web applications.

🗄️ MSSQL Server: A popular system used for database management.

🔍 LINQ: A powerful language used for querying and manipulating data.

📦 Entity Framework (Code First): ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool used for database operations.

⚙️ View Components: Page management and dynamic content creation.

📩 Message Sending Feature: Message sending capability in the user panel.

✅ To-Do List: To-do list, tasks are marked as they are completed.

📬 Incoming Messages: Messages from the user are displayed as pop-ups.

📱 Social Media Accounts: Social media accounts can be edited.



🖥️ User Interface:
The user interface in the project is designed so that the user can view information such as "About Me", "Places I Work", "My Projects", "My Skills" and "References". Dynamic statistics and social media accounts are also visually presented. Users can communicate with the admin with the message sending feature.



🔑 Admin Panel:
All CRUD operations can be performed in the admin panel. The admin can create tasks in the to-do list (To-Do List) and mark the task when completed. In addition, incoming messages are displayed as pop-ups and the admin can manage these messages. The statistics section in the admin panel is larger than the user panel.
